<blockquote>
    <p><strong>LOVBORG.</strong></p>
    <p><em>I? Through the streets? Would you have people see her walking with me?</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>HEDDA.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Of course I don't know what else may have happened last night. But is it so utterly irretrievable?</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>LOVBORG.</strong></p>
    <p><em>It will not end with last night--I know that perfectly well. And the thing is that now I have no taste for that sort of life either. I won't begin it anew. She has broken my courage and my power of braving life out.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>HEDDA.</strong></p>
    <p><em>[Looking straight before her.] So that pretty little fool has had her fingers in a man's destiny. [Looks at him.] But all the same, how could you treat her so heartlessly.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>LOVBORG.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Oh, don't say that I was heartless!</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>HEDDA.</strong></p>
    <p><em>To go and destroy what has filled her whole soul for months and years! You do not call that heartless!</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>LOVBORG.</strong></p>
    <p><em>To you I can tell the truth, Hedda.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>HEDDA.</strong></p>
    <p><em>The truth?</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>LOVBORG.</strong></p>
    <p><em>First promise me--give me your word--that what I now confide in you Thea shall never know.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>HEDDA.</strong></p>
    <p><em>I give you my word.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>LOVBORG.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Good. Then let me tell you that what I said just now was untrue.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>HEDDA.</strong></p>
    <p><em>About the manuscript?</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>LOVBORG.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Yes. I have not torn it to pieces--nor thrown it into the fiord.</em></p>
